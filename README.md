## Introduction
Agriculture has been known to be the mainstay of the economies of African countries, mainly Sub-Saharan African countries. According to a [book](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/agricultural-productivity-africa-trends-patterns-and-determinants) written on African agricultural productivity in 2016, agricultural productivity in Africa increased at a moderate rate between 1961 and 2012, although there are variations in the rate of growth in land, labor, and total factor productivities depending on country and region.

According to [Action Against Hunger](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/the-hunger-crisis/world-hunger-facts/#:~:text=Global%20hunger%20crisis%20in%202023,and%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.), after steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is said to be on the rise, affecting nearly 10% of people globally. From 2019 to 2022, the number of undernourished people grew by as many as 150 million, a crisis driven largely by conflict, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, in this project, I seek to find out for myself these trends in food production and supply, specifically between the years 2004 and 2013. I also aim to describe how Africa can contribute to reducing world hunger. This will be covered according to the sections as listed above.

### Features of the Datasets.
There were two datasets provided for this project. The first one covered the figures of food production, while the second covered food supply across 45 African countries.

##### Food Production Dataset:
1. Country: The name of the country.
2. Item: The name of the produce from each country.
3. Year: The year of production.
4. Value: The quantity of each item, measured in kilotonnes (kt).

##### Food Supply Dataset:
1. Country: The name of the country.
2. Year: The year of supply.
3. Value: The quantity supplied, measured in kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/day).

## Recommendations & Conclusion.

In conclusion, given all the insights obtained from these datasets, I recommend that:
- African countries need to be more intentional about a switch from subsistence to commercial agriculture. This can be done by increasing production, fostering research into new ways of growing crops or rearing animals, more ideas of food and livestock processing. 
- Storage facilities should be developed and/or improved so ensure the longevity of produce. 
- Pan-African trade measures should also be taken into consideration, as there are nations that may not have adequate arable land like others. 

These steps, I'm sure, will increase per capita supply of food and the overall Gross Domestic Product of African countries. They will also ensure that Africa takes her place in the reduction, and hopefully, elimination of world hunger.
